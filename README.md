This landing page is an example of the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to handle dynamically-generated content when populating a page design. The code tracks users scroll position to update certain page characteristics while navigating the content.


## Usage

To view the sample page, just download or clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/paulmreese/fend-landing-page.git
```

Then, open the `index.html` file in your internet browser to see the page in action!
